# Project Overview
This project is a study case of Three.js and React, and also serves as a solution to a task list provided by Goldspot. The project features several pages, including a homepage, About page, Works page, Contact page, and Login page.

## Home
The homepage features several study cases using Three.js, including one that utilizes particle concepts and different textures, and another that features a simple import of a 3D model. Both study cases offer camera interactions.

## About
The About page is currently under development.

## Works
The Works page is also currently under development.

## Contact
The Contact page is currently under development.

## Login
The Login page features a simple login form that allows users to access the specific study cases. If you would like to access this page, please email ahmad.forhat@gmail.com, and we will be happy to provide you with access.

## Security
For this project, I implemented a basic token security in the login system that allows access to the endpoint only if the token is validated. To improve the security of the system, it would be a good idea to implement JWT Authentication with a refresh token. Additionally, code verification with email or cellphone should be used based on the application's security requirements.

## Next steps
- Enhance the mobile experience.
- Add more filters to the drawer, such as createdDate range, company, and others.
- Create dashboards to better understand the data.
- Implement real-time monitoring of job progress and status updates.
- Implement a notification system to alert users when their jobs complete or encounter errors.
